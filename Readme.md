The *Farming Simulator Dedicated Server* software allows to run a Farming Simulator multiplayer server without having players online. The farm-world can run 24/7 and players can login-in and play together whenever they want.

I contributed to this project as a C++ Software Engineer at Giants Software GmbH in 2013.  
GIANTS Software GmbH is a Swiss game developer company and inventor of the *Farming Simulator* franchise.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Develop the web application *Dedicated Server for Farming Simulator 2013* in **C++**  
ðŸ’¡ Further develop and extend an existing **HTTP** webserver in **C++**

An action game where a tank must fight its way through a 3D city full of hostile enemy tanks.

This game was created as a final project during the lecture
'[Computer Graphics Lab](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/computer-graphics-fs20.html)' at the University of Zurich, in cooperation with two fellow students.

The goal of the project was the implementation of a functioning 3D computer game in a group of three during a time period of three weeks.

My assignment in the project group was the implementation of the ballistics for grenades and projectiles, the implementation of the particle systems as well as the programming of a fast and precise collision detection.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Implement particle systems rendering  
ðŸ’¡ Develop a fast and precise collision detection  
ðŸ’¡ Implement ballistics for the grenades and projectiles

*O2* is a C++ cross-platform 2D game engine. It currently supports Android and Windows.

The engine is strongly influenced by the SFML library. SFML does not officially support mobile platforms, so I dedided to roll my own engine and use SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) as a basis for the platform dependent functionality like input/ouptut and window creation. The rendering is done in OpenGL and OpenGL ES, without using abstractions from SDL.
The engine is fully integrated into Visual Studio, i.e. the game can be built and debugged from within Visual Studio for both Windows and Android.

After tinkering with the engine code for quite some time, I decided to create an actual self-contained game with it. The result is a game called **O2 Blocks** - see screenshots. It's something similiar to Tetris, but with over-the-top effects and explosions. The game also features the supposedly most annoying sound effects of all time ðŸ˜‰

I strive to continuously improve the code and add new functionality to the engine. The next step will be refactoring the audio code to use the audio library [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio), instead of the dated SDL audio capabilities which are currently in use. I also plan to move the engine code, which currently lives inside the game, to a dedicated repository.

The 2D engine currently supports the following features  
- Cross-platform on Windows and Android
- Fully integrated into Visual Studio 2022
- Batched 2D texture rendering using OpenGL
- Input/Output handling (mouse, keyboard, mobile touch screen)
- Logging
- Animation system using [tweens](http://robertpenner.com/easing/)
- Camera system
- Particle systems
- Music and Sound playback

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Create the O2 game engine code based on **SDL**, using **OpenGL** and **C++**  
ðŸ’¡ Create the tetris-inspired game **O2 Blocks**, based on the O2 Game Engine

An Arkanoid inspired action game, made with the Unity 3D Engine.

This was my biggest personal project in Unity 3D so far. Code and graphics were all created by myself. To create the graphics, I used the open source vector graphics software Inkscape.  
I really wanted to make a self-containted, complete game with production quality. I even took some time off from my regular job to learn Unity 3D and complete this project! Finally, I published the app to the Android App Store.

The Android version (not available anymore) contained some commercially licensed elements. To avoid copyright issues, I replaced these textures / music clips with placeholders in the downloadable Windows version above. This means, that some textures have reduced quality in this version.

### My contribution to the project

Pretty much everything was made by myself:  
ðŸ’¡ Create and code the game using **Unity 3D** and **C#**  
ðŸ’¡ Create most of the graphics assets using graphics software like **Inkscape** and **Gimp**   
ðŸ’¡ Edit free music and sound clips using the audio software **Audacity**

You are a simple Space-Engineer shortly before finishing his last day at work and being off to retirement as the phone rings and he is handed down one small last task. An A.I. on the interstellar defense platform "N3-BUL-0N" has gone mad and threatens to destroy planet earth. 
Being the one with the most experience, you are entrusted in reaching the platform's core and pull the plug.  
If only it were that easy... 

This game was created during the [Global Game Jam 2015](https://globalgamejam.org/) by two fellow game creators and me in one weekend. It's a puzzle game where you have to make your way through various maze-like levels by activating switches which in turn open doors leading to the exit.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Create and code the game using **Unity 3D** and **C#**  
ðŸ’¡ Plan the level and game design in a group of three

## 2D Rigid Body Physics

<img src="https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body/blob/main/docs/screenshots/RigidBodyScreenshot2.png?raw=true" alt="Rigid Body Screenshot" style="max-height: 400px"/>

ðŸ”— [Github Repository](https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body)  
ðŸ”— [Download Page (Windows)](https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body/releases)  

This program is a simple 2D physics simulation, inspired by the [Rigid Body Dynamics Tutorial by Chris Hecker](https://www.chrishecker.com/Rigid_Body_Dynamics)

The program simulates a freely movable two dimensional cube which hangs on two ropes. One rope can be moved around using the mouse.  
The two ropes can be toggled on or off. If you set them to off, the cube will fall to the ground in a physically accurate way.  

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Implement a simple **2D rigid body physics** simulation and 2D rendering in **OpenGL**

## Arcade Game Clones with SDL / SFML

Two arcade game clones I made with the SDL and with the SFML game library, respectively.  
Nothing fancy, just two basic clones of Tetris and Breakout.  
These projects were my first attempts at using SDL and SFML. Especially the clean and simple api of SFML piqued my interest in game libraries and game programming in general.

### My contribution to the projects

ðŸ’¡ Implement a Tetris clone in **C++** and **SDL**  
ðŸ’¡ Implement a Breakout clone in **C++** and **SFDML**
